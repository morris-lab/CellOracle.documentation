Tutorial
========

This tutorial aims to introduce how to use CellOracle functions using the demo dataset.
Once you get used to CellOracle codes, please replace demo data with your data to investigate it.

What the tutorial covers
------------------------

1. Main celloracle analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :doc:`networkanalysis`: This notebook introduces how to construct sample-specific GRN models. It also contains examples of network analysis with graph theory.
- :doc:`simulation` : This notebook performs in silico gene perturbation analysis using GRN models.


.. note::
   Demo dataset is available in the tutorial notebooks above. You can try CellOracle even if you do not have any data.

2. How to prepare input data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We recommend getting started with CellOracle using demo dataset. Please get used to CellOracle analysis with them first.
When you want to apply CellOracle to your scRNA-seq or scATAC dataset, please refer to the following tutorials to know how to prepare input data.

- :doc:`scrnaprocess`: This notebook explains preprocessing steps for scRNA-seq data.
- :doc:`base_grn`: This tutorial explains how to prepare input data for TF motif scan.
- :doc:`motifscan`: This tutorial describes the TF motif scan pipeline for base-GRN construction.

.. warning::
   In the input data preparation, we introduce how to prepare input data using some other libraries.
   But **the input data preparation notebook is NOT CellOracle analysis itself**, and we just provide an example how to leverage pre-existing tools **to prepare input data**.
   CellOracle is not a pipeline for scRNA-seq / scATAC-seq data preprocessing.


Prerequisites
-------------

- This tutorial assumes that you have some Python programming experience. In particular, we assume you are familiar with Python data science libraries: jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib.

- Also, this tutorial assume that you are familiar with basic scRNA-seq data analysis. In particular, we assume you have some experience of scRNA-seq analysis using `Scanpy and Anndata <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ , which is a python toolkit for single-cell analysis. You can use scRNA-seq data processed with `Seurat <https://satijalab.org/seurat/>`_ . But the Seurat data need to be converted into Anndata format in advance to CellOracle analysis. See this  `page  <https://morris-lab.github.io/CellOracle.documentation/modules/index.html#command-line-api>`_ for detail.

- CellOracle provides pre-build base-GRN, and it is not necessary to construct custom base-GRN. But if you want to construct custom base-GRN from your scATAC-seq data, we recommend using `Cicero <https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/>`_ . In this case, please get used to Cicero, basic scATAC-seq data analysis, and TF motif analysis in advance to start constructing base-GRN.



Code and data availability
--------------------------


- We provide link for the notebook in each section.

- You can download demo input data using the notebooks.

- We provide intermediate files. You can start at any section.

Getting started
----------------

If you run CellOracle for the first time, please start with the :doc:`networkanalysis`. And then, please proceed to :doc:`simulation`.
We provide demo scRNA-seq dataset and base-GRN data as follows.
You can load these data using the CellOracle data loading function.

- scRNA-seq data: Hematopoiesis dataset published by `Paul et al (2015) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415014932?via%3Dihub>`_ .
- Base-GRN: Base-GRN generated from `Mouse sci-ATAC-seq atlas dataset <https://atlas.gs.washington.edu/mouse-atac/>`_ .

You can easily start CellOracle analysis with this dataset.
You can reproduce hematopoiesis network analysis and perturbation simulation results that are shown in `our bioarxiv preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.947416v3>`_ .
