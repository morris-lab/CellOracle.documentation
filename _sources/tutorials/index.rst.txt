Tutorial
========

The analysis proceeds through multiple steps.
Please run the notebooks sequentially.
If you do not have ATAC-seq data and want to use the default TF binding information, you can skip the first and second step and start from the third step.

Please refer to the ``celloracle`` paper for scientific premise and the detail of the algorithm of celloracle.


The jupyter notebook files and data used in this tutorial are available `here <https://github.com/morris-lab/CellOracle/tree/master/docs/notebooks>`_ .
